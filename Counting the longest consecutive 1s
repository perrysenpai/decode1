Given a number N. The task is to find the length of the longest consecutive 1s in its binary representation.

Approach: Lets take a number 11011110
          if we left shift the number by 1 and and it with the current number than the number of time loop runs before the number becomes 0 
          is the count of consequtive 1s.
          
      while(x!=0)
	    {
	        x&=(x<<1);
	        count++;
	    }
	    
	    System.out.println(count);
      
      
      
      e.g.  11011110
      ls    10111100     
      &     10011100
      
      ls    00111000
      &     00011000
      
      ls  ` 00110000
      &     00010000
      
      ls    00100000
      &     00000000    i.e 4 
      
      
      this happens because lets say there are 4 consequtive 1s, with each each ls operation only 3 of these one will line up and and will 
      procuce 3 consequtive ones
      after this ls of these produces 2 1s lining up and so on until no 1s line up
