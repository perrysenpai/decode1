Problem: 
Given a Binary Tree and a target key, your task is to complete the function getLevel() that returns the level of the key from the given binary tree.

           3
         /   \
        2     5
      /   \
     1     4
Key: 4
Level: 3 

APPROACH :  we start with root node and start traversing the left and right subtree. when key value is encountered (lets say in the left subtree)
the right one has still no key value. we take advantage of this , which is illustrated int eh code below:

public static int getLevel(Node root, int key)
{
    if(root==null)
    return 0;
    
    if(root.data==key)
    return 1;
    
    int left=getLevel(root.left, key);     // whenever node with key value is found one of the values i.e left or right becomes one , other is zero.
    int right=getLevel(root.right, key);
    
    if(left==0 && right==0)
    return 0;
    
   
    if(left==0)
    return right+1;
    
    return left+1;  // for right==0  
    // due to this the value of left or right is increases by one as we go up the tree.
}
