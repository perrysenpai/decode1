Given a Binary Tree and a number k. Print all nodes that are at distance k from root (root is considered at distance 0 from itself). Nodes should be printed from left to right. If k is more that height of tree, nothing should be printed.

For example, if below is given tree and k is 2. Output should be 4 5 6.
